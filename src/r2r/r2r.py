"""
This file contains all of the logic related to performing widening and deepening transforms and initializations.

For a nn.Module to be widened it needs to implement the following interface for *linear layer enumeration*:
network_instance.lle()

OR a more complex nn.Module involving more than a linear sequence of nn.Modules (i.e. iff it uses concatenation) must 
implement the following interface for *hidden volume graph* creation:
network_instance.hvg()

For a nn.Module to be deepened, it needs to implement the following interface:
network_instance.conv_forward(x) - the conv portion of the network
network_instance.fc_forward(x)   - the fc portion of the network
network_instance.out_forward(x)  - the output portion of the network (anything that happens after the fc networks)

If we wish for a nn.Module to ever be widened after a deepen transform, then, we must implement the following additional 
functions, which break down the computation of :
network_instance.conv_lle()
network_instance.fc_lle()
OR
network_instance.conv_hvg()
network_instance.fc_hvg()


We use the following python and PyTorch conventions for function naming very explicitly:
_function_name = a private/helper function, not to be exported;
function_name_ = a function that has side effects (will change the objects that have been passed into them).

Note, that this means that we will sometimes be declaring function names like '_function_name_', when both cases are true.

    This function will widen the hidden volume output by a convolutional layer, or the hidden units output
