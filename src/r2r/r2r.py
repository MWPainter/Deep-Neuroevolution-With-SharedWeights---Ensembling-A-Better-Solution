"""
This file contains all of the logic related to performing widening and deepening transforms. 

We define a number of interfaces that need to be implemented by a nn.Module in order to use the R2R functions.

We use the following python and PyTorch conventions for function naming very explicitly:
_function_name = a private/helper function, not to be exported;
function_name_ = a function that has side effects (will change the objects that have been passed into them).

Note, that this means that we will sometimes be declaring function names like '_function_name_', when both cases are true.

The three functions that a user should look at potentially using for their function preserving widening/deepening needs 
are:
- r_2_wider_r_              - widen a single hidden volume
- widen_network_            - widen all hidden volumes in a network
- make_deeper_network_      - deepen a network




R2WiderR interface (required by nn.Modules that wish to use R2WiderR):
- network_instance.hvg()
    This returns a HVG object that describes the 'Hidden Volume Graph' defined by the network. See our examples 
    and the definition of the HVG object for how to use this. (Todo at some point: add some sort of diagram).
Example implementations: Mnist_Resnet, Cifar_Resnet
    
    

    
R2DeeperR interface (required by nn.Modules that wish to use R2DeeperR):
- network_instance.conv_forward(x) 
    The convolutional portion of forward for the nn.Module
- network_instance.fc_forward(x)
    The fully connected portion of forward for the nn.Module
- network_instance.out_forward(x)
    The output portion of forward for the nn.Module
- network_instance.forward()
    Should be equal to network_instance.out_forward(network_instance.fc_forward(network_instance.conv_forward(x)))
Example implementations: Mnist_Resnet, Cifar_Resnet




R2R interface (required by nn.Modules that wish to use R2DeeperR and R2WiderR):
- all of R2WiderR interface, where:
    - network_instance.hvg()
        Should just chain together the building of conv_hvg() and fc_hvg() below. (See examples).
- all of R2DeeperR interface
- network_instance.input_shape()
    Returns the input shape to the network.
- network_instance.conv_hvg(cur_hvg)
    If the network instance implements the hvg function for R2WiderR, then is should implement building the conv part 
    of the hvg with this method, given the 'cur_hvg', which should just consist of the input volume. This function 
    should return the resulting hvg.
- network_instance.fc_hvg(cur_hvg)
    If the network instance implements the hvg function for R2WiderR, then is should implement building the fully 
    connected part of the hvg with this method, given the 'cur_hvg', which is the hvg output by the conv_hvg part. 
    This function should return the resulting hvg.
Example implementations: Mnist_Resnet, Cifar_Resnet
    
    
    
    
R2DeeperRBlock interface (required by any nn.Module that wishes to be the block used for extending in R2DeeperR):
- identity initialization
    The nn.Module should be initialized such that it is an identity operation if the transform is wished to be 
    function preserving. (Recommended that the initializer takes an argument that can set if it's identity initialized 
    or not).
- block.conv_hvg(cur_hvg)
    The nn.Module should implement a conv_hvg function, for the hvg interface, so that it can be used in future widening 
    operations, where the 'base_network' implemented the hvg interface. This should

    Single interface for r2widerr transforms, where prev_layers and next_layers could be a single layer.

    'volume_shape' refers to the shape that we wish to widen, and 'prev_layers' and 'next_layers' are the nn.Modules
    that we will edit to widen in a function preserving way.

    At a high level, we are considering the local operation of next(phi(prev(...))), where phi is any channel wise
    function. phi can incorporate batch norm, which is fed into the 'batch_norm' input and 'next_layer_spatial_ratio'
    allows for the fact that phi may involve an operation that reduces the spatial dimension of the hidden volume.

    Therefore, if volume_shape = (c,h,w) is the output from the 'prev_layers' then the volume input to each of the
    nn.Module's in 'next_layers' is (c,h/r,w/r), where r=next_layer_spatial_ratio.

    Very frequently next_layer_spatial_ratio should be equal to 1. An example of where it should be different is if
    part of phi is a max pooling module. If we have a max pool with kernel size (2,2), then the
    next_layer_spatial_ratio should be equal to 2.
    
    For now, with convolutions, we only support variable sizes kernels, strides and padding. We don't support 
    any non-default padding and so on.
    
    Finally, we allow ourselves to initialize the new varialbles in such a way that the functions output is 
    preserved. This is implemented using the 'alpha' variable of the underlying functions that initialize the 
    new weights.
    
    For now we support the following *ordered* pairs of nn.Modules:
    (nn.Conv2d, nn.Conv2d)
    (nn.Conv2d, nn.Linear)
    (nn.Linear, nn.Linear)

    :param next_layers: A (list of) layer(s) layer after the hidden volume/units being widened (inputs are the

    :param next_layer_spatial_ratio: The ratio of the spatial dimensions for the volume input to 'next_layers' with
            respect to the spatial dimensions output from 'prev_layers'.

            used for a residual connection at some point later in the network y, with y = residual_connection(y,x)).
            This should be none if it's not used as part of a residual connection.
